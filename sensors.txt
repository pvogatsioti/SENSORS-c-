This is a program that simulates what is written below.                            
                                                                                   
In a forest area which is a rectangular with coordinates from (0,0) to (1600,1600) 
10 fire sensors are placed randomly. Every sensor has some characterestics. These  
are the coordinates of the area in which is placed, the polution percentage in the 
area and the limit above of the polution becomes dangerous.                        
                                                                                   
Every 5 minutes each sensor measures the polution in the area which is placed. If  
it is above the limit, it sends the data to a central system which prints in the   
screen the coordinates, the percentage of the poluted areas and the average        
polution in that area.

There are two types of sensors. NOK sensors and ERIC sensors. There is a 0.1% possibility 
of mistake in every measurement of NOK sensors.
ERIC sensors have some additional characteristics. They also measure every ten minutes the 
humidity percentage in the ara they are placed. If it is lower than the limit there is a 
fire danger so they send the information to the fire department.

The fire department has a unit of 8 people that go to the area with the lower percentage of 
humidity.
